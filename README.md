# DORK

DORK is a web-first, sarcastic text adventure inspired by classic interactive fiction.
It does not want to hurt you.
It will anyway.

## Features (Planned)
- Parser-based gameplay
- Data-driven world design
- Class-based failure modifiers
- Adjustable snark levels
- UI that looks suspicious but works perfectly

## Non-Goals
- Realism
- Hand-holding
- Bards

## Status
Barely alive. Improving.
